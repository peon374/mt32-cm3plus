# Pi-Compute-3-Lite-BLANK
******************************************
PROJECT HAS BEEN UPDATED TO KICAD V5.0!
******************************************

The schematic will require some custom parts that can be found in our other repository [RPi_CM3_Parts](https://github.com/tmtrcreations/RPi_CM3_Parts). The schematic contains everything required to get the CM3L to run. The rest of the pins are free to be used for any project. These files are meant to help jumpstart a project that wants to build around the CM3L.
