# mt32-cm3plus
This is a CM3+ version of the MT32Pi hardware. All layout is done in Kicad and I will create release files with everything needed to get a run of boards done and half assembled with jlcpcb.

This project is a hardware implementation designed to work with [MT32-Pi](https://github.com/dwhinham/mt32-pi)
